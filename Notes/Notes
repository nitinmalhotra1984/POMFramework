For log4j - there are 4 types of logs - 
1) Info; 2) Warning; 3) Error and 4) fatal

how to generate the logs - use Apache log4j API
how it works - it reads log 4j configuration from log4j.properties file
where to create - we need to create a source folder - src/main/resources folder
and add log4j.properties file there.
